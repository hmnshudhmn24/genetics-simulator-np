# ðŸ§¬ NumPy Genetics Simulator

This project uses NumPy to simulate basic genetic population dynamics over multiple generations. It tracks allele frequencies (A and a), simulates reproduction with crossover, and includes mutation modeling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Mendelian inheritance logic with random allele selection
- Mutation modeling with adjustable rate
- Allele frequency tracking across generations
- Streamlit-powered interactive simulation

## ðŸ’¡ Twist

Model real-time allele shifts in a population and visualize how evolution and randomness affect genetic drift!

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib streamlit
```

2. Launch the app:

```bash
streamlit run src/main.py
```

## ðŸ“Š What It Shows

- Dynamic change in allele frequencies (`A` and `a`)
- Mutation impact on genetic diversity
- Population-wide stochastic evolution
